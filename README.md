## 📿 Interactive Rosary

This is a **fully responsive** web application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) designed as an interactive tool for the Rosary prayer. It guides the user through the prayer sequence by automatically **highlighting the current bead** and prayer, providing a focused and accessible experience on any device.

## ✨ Features

  * **Full Responsiveness:** The entire rosary structure dynamically scales using `vmin` (Viewport Minimum) units and dynamic positioning logic in JavaScript, ensuring it renders and functions correctly on any screen size, from desktops to mobile phones.
  * **Interactive Zoom:** The view automatically zooms in on the active bead and cross, helping the user maintain focus on the current prayer point.
  * **Theme & Background:** The design features classic reddish-brown beads and a silver cross, set against the background of St. Peter's Square in the Vatican.
  * **Intuitive Control:** Easily navigate using on-screen buttons (**Next**, **Back**, **Reset**) or keyboard controls (Right/Left Arrow, Space, Esc).
